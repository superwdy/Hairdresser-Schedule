For the Program:

1.Import “datetime” library to check time and to realize summation of time.
2. In terms of objected-oriented design, create a base class “Service” from which two subclasses “Hairclass” and “Shampoo_Haircut” to optimize the scalability of the whole program.
3. Define several functions.
    And invoke recursively once the program come up with an error in some places.




How to run the program?

Step 1:
Open you shell.
Step 2:
cd to the project folder “Haircut”.
Step 3:
cd to the project folder “venv”.
Step 4:
Type “python Haircut.py”

Congrat! There we go!!!



Test cases:

1. schedule => haircut => 08:00 => 0 => schedule => shampoo => 08:15
Program prompts an error because the new shampoo appointment conflicts with the haircut appointment at 08:00.
2. schedule => haircut => 08:00 => schedule => shampoo => 08:30 => list
The program list two appointments with the info about services, time and ID in order.
[Haircut, 08:00, 0] and [Shampoo&Haircut, 08:30, 1]
3. exit
The program exits the whole program and prompts “You exited the program!”.aysql-connector-python-cext
